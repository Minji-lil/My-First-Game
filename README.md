# My First Game

I am trying to learn SFML after learning Object Oriented Programming in C++. I am not following any specific courses on Youtube or anywhere else, but if I do encounter any issues, I would simply search them up on the Internet. The book I have used for learning SFML on my own is "SFML GAME DEVELOPMENT" by Jan Haller, Henrik Vogelius Hansson, Artur Moreira. This project is still in the process of development.
