# My First Game

Using SFML library to build my first game in C++. I am not following any specific courses on Youtube or anywhere else, but if I do encounter any issues, I would simply search them up on the Internet. The book I have used for learning SFML on my own is "SFML GAME DEVELOPMENT" by Jan Haller, Henrik Vogelius Hansson, Artur Moreira. This project is still in the process of development.


It is under development.
